    <p>### 1 Phases of the Project Management Life Cycle

        The Project Management Life Cycle typically consists of the following phases:
        
        1. **Initiation**: Defining the project at a high level, securing approval, and allocating initial resources.
        2. **Planning**: Detailed planning of the project scope, schedule, costs, quality, communication, risk management, and resources.
        3. **Execution**: Carrying out the project plan by coordinating people and resources, as well as integrating and performing project activities.
        4. **Monitoring and Controlling**: Tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project, identifying any areas where changes to the plan are required.
        5. **Closure**: Finalizing all project activities, delivering the completed product to the customer, and formally closing the project.
        
        ### 1 (b) Difference Between Predictive Life Cycle and Adaptive Software Development Life Cycle
        
        **Predictive Life Cycle (Waterfall Model):**
        
        - **Definition**: This approach is also known as the waterfall model. It is sequential and follows a fixed plan from start to finish.
        - **Planning**: Comprehensive planning is done at the beginning of the project, and changes are minimized during execution.
        - **Flexibility**: It is inflexible with respect to changes, as requirements are expected to be clearly defined from the start.
        - **Risk Management**: Risks are identified and mitigated early, but changing requirements can introduce new risks.
        - **Customer Involvement**: Customer involvement is typically lower after initial requirements gathering, with reviews primarily at major milestones.
        
        **Adaptive Software Development Life Cycle (Agile Model):**
        
        - **Definition**: This approach is iterative and incremental, allowing for ongoing changes and adaptation throughout the project.
        - **Planning**: Planning is continuous and adaptive, allowing for frequent revisions based on feedback.
        - **Flexibility**: It is highly flexible, accommodating changes even late in the development process.
        - **Risk Management**: Continuous risk management is integral, with regular assessments and adaptations to manage new risks.
        - **Customer Involvement**: High customer involvement is maintained throughout the project, with frequent feedback and collaboration.
        
        ### 1 (c) Trends Affecting Information Technology Project Management Recently
        
        1. **Increased Adoption of Agile and Hybrid Methodologies**:
           - Many organizations are shifting towards Agile methodologies to enhance flexibility and responsiveness to changing project requirements. Hybrid methodologies that combine Agile with traditional approaches are also gaining popularity, allowing teams to customize their approach to better fit the project's needs.
        
        2. **Emphasis on Cybersecurity and Data Privacy**:
           - With the rising number of cyber threats and stringent data protection regulations, there is a growing focus on integrating robust cybersecurity measures and data privacy protocols into IT project management. This trend ensures that projects are not only completed successfully but also securely, protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with legal standards.</p>
